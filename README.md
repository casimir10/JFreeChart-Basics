# JFreeChart Basics

Repository includes Code and a Screenshot of the completed Line Graph

I used JFreeChart to create the visualization using java, the data question that I wanted to visualize was: What were the most
popular genres during the 1990s?


PURPOSE: Implmement a method of data Visualization to represent the most popular movie genres throughout the 1990s

This was an exercise in Data extraction, sorting and visualization. 

The following techniques were used:

- Importing 3rd Party packages (JFreeChart)
- Utilizing JFreeChart library methods to render statistical Data in Line Charts
- Reading in and extracting Data from txt/csv files
- Utilizing Hashmaps data structure to store genre frequencies
- Splitting read data on a specified delimiter ("," and "|")
- Sending output to a seperate file for viewing

NOTE: The sample size of the graph is small due to the limited capabilites of the Eclipse IDE at the time,
it does not seem to allow large amounts of data to be processed at once hence I could not get anymore than about 300 songs..
