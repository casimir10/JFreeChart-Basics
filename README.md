The Extra Credit is included in this Repository for HW4, both the Code and a Screenshot of the completed Line Graph
NOTE: The sample size of the graph is small due to the limited capabilites of the Eclipse IDE,
it does not seem to allow large amounts of data to be processed at once hence I could not get anymore than about 300 songs. I still
managed to work with what I had available.

I used JFreeChart to create the visualization using java, the data question that I wanted to visualize was: What were the most
popular genres during the 1990s?
